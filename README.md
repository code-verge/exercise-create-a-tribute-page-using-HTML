## Instructions

Got an idea about who to dedicate your tribute page to?

If not, your first task is to figure out who you want to write about!

Remember, it can be a historical figure, a celebrity or any person of influence.

Donâ€™t overthink it as your tribute webpage will be a simple one-pager.

git push origin main
```

## Bonus Challenges

If youâ€™re up for a little extra challenge, you can try to do the following:

- Enhance your webpage by using multiple heading levels (`<h1>` through `<h6>`). Structure your content to create a clear and visually appealing hierarchy.
- Write multiple paragraphs to enrich your tribute page.
- Experiment with the `<pre>` tag to create some visual disruption in your text. Use it to display formatted text that stands out from the rest of your page.
- Add `title` attributes to your HTML elements to create informative tooltips. When you hover over these elements, there should be helpful explanations or fun facts about your content.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
